# Instructions to Play
This is a two-player ping-pong game running across two laptops on the same Wi-Fi network.

## On the Server Laptop (Player 1)
Step 1: Find Your Local IP Address: Find the local IP address of the computer that will act as the server.

On Windows: Open Command Prompt and type ipconfig. Look for the "IPv4 Address" under your Wi-Fi adapter. 
On macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal and type ifconfig or ip a. Look for the "inet" address with your Wi-Fi interface.

Step 2: Run the Server Script.
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to where you saved the file, and run it with the command:
        python server.py
The terminal will print "Waiting for a connection...". It is now waiting for Player 2 to join.

## On the Client Laptop (Player 2)
Step 3: Edit the Client Script with correct server IP.
    Find the line in game.py that says SERVER_IP = "YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE".
    Replace "YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE" with the actual local IP address you found in Step 1.
Save the file.

Step 4: Run the Client Script:
Navigate to where you saved the game file, and run it:
        python client.py
The game should start on both screens simultaneously!
